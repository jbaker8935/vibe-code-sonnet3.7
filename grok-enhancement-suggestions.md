As a game developer prototyping this two-player game for a vibe coding jam, I’ve analyzed the current rules from game_rule_summary.md and considered ways to enhance them. The game is already engaging with its 8x4 board, strategic swapping mechanics, and goal of connecting rows 1 and 6. Your current implementation allows players to choose starting positions and AI difficulty, which is a great foundation. Below, I propose several enhancements to make the game more challenging, fun, and replayable, while building on the existing mechanics and addressing your suggestions (e.g., challenges with increasing difficulty, target cell connections, swapping with own pieces, and unmarking mechanics). These ideas aim to deepen strategy, encourage replay, and avoid issues like deadlocks or repetition where possible.

1. Introduce Board Variations with Obstacles
Description: Add immovable obstacles to the board—cells that cannot be occupied or moved through. These could be placed in different patterns for each game or level, creating unique layouts.
How It Works: Before the game starts, a set number of cells (e.g., 2–4) are designated as obstacles. For example, cells like (3,1) and (4,2) might be blocked, forcing players to navigate around them.
Benefits:
Replayability: Different obstacle patterns create fresh challenges each time, encouraging players to adapt their strategies.
Challenge: Obstacles can block direct paths between rows 1 and 6, making connections harder to achieve and requiring creative positioning.
Progression: You could design a "campaign mode" with levels of increasing difficulty—e.g., Level 1 has no obstacles, Level 2 has 2 obstacles, Level 3 has 4 obstacles in trickier spots.
Example: Imagine obstacles at (2,1) and (5,2). Player A (starting at rows 6 and 7) must maneuver pieces around these blocks to reach row 1, while Player B (starting at rows 0 and 1) faces similar challenges reaching row 6. This adds a puzzle-like element to the game.
2. Specify Target Cells for Connections
Description: Replace the current goal of connecting any cells in rows 1 and 6 with a requirement to connect specific target cells in those rows. Each player gets a unique pair of cells to link with a path of their pieces.
How It Works: For example, Player A must connect (1,0) to (6,0), and Player B must connect (1,3) to (6,3). The first player to form a connected path between their targets wins.
Benefits:
Strategy: Players must focus on controlling specific paths (e.g., a column or diagonal), leading to more direct competition and blocking opportunities.
Variety: Different target pairs can be assigned per game, making each match unique and encouraging replay to master various objectives.
Challenge: Targeting specific cells is harder than connecting entire rows, especially if combined with obstacles.
Example: If Player A’s targets are (1,0) and (6,0), they’ll prioritize the leftmost column, while Player B (targeting (1,3) and (6,3)) focuses on the right. Swapping becomes a tool to disrupt these specific paths, heightening tension.
3. Allow Swapping with Own Pieces to Manage States
Description: Add a new move where a player can swap two of their own adjacent pieces (orthogonally or diagonally). If either piece is marked as swapped, this move unmarks it, making it eligible again as a swap target.
How It Works: On their turn, a player can choose to either move a piece to an adjacent cell (empty or opponent-occupied, per current rules) or swap two of their own pieces. For example, if Player A’s piece at (6,0) is swapped (marked) and adjacent to their piece at (7,1), they can swap them, unmarking the (6,0) piece.
Benefits:
Depth: Players gain more control over their pieces’ states, adding a layer of strategy—do they spend a turn resetting a piece or advancing their position?
Flexibility: This reduces reliance on the global unmarking rule (moving to an empty cell), making state management more deliberate.
Advanced Play: This could be an optional rule for experienced players or unlocked in higher difficulty levels.
Example: Player B has a swapped piece at (1,2) critical to their path. By swapping it with their own piece at (2,3), they unmark it, allowing it to be swapped with Player A’s piece later, opening new tactical options.
Additional Notes on Design
Avoiding Deadlocks and Repetition:
Obstacles: Naturally guide players toward varied strategies by altering the board’s topology, reducing repetitive moves.
Target Cells: Focuses gameplay on specific goals, minimizing aimless wandering or stalemates (though blocking could increase draws—mitigated by strategic swapping).
Swapping Own Pieces: Costs a turn, preventing overuse, and since it’s optional per move, it won’t loop endlessly.
Balancing Complexity:
Obstacles and target cells are simple to implement and intuitive for new players, enhancing challenge without overwhelming them.
Swapping with own pieces adds depth but could be introduced gradually (e.g., as a rule toggle or in later levels) to keep the base game accessible.
Encouraging Replay:
Board variations and target cells offer endless configurations—pair them with your existing starting position options for even more variety.
A campaign mode (e.g., Level 1: standard rules, Level 2: obstacles, Level 3: target cells) provides progression, motivating players to keep coming back.
Fun Factor: These enhancements make every match visually and strategically distinct, rewarding clever planning and adaptability—key to a vibe coding jam standout.
Implementation Suggestions
Campaign Mode: Combine these ideas into a series of challenges:
Level 1: Standard rules (connect rows 1 and 6).
Level 2: Add 2 obstacles in the middle (e.g., (3,1), (4,2)).
Level 3: Target cells (e.g., Player A: (1,0) to (6,0), Player B: (1,3) to (6,3)).
Level 4: Include obstacles and swapping with own pieces.
UI Integration: Leverage your current setup—let players select obstacle patterns or target cells alongside starting positions and AI difficulty.
AI Difficulty: Scale the AI to exploit these new rules (e.g., smarter blocking with obstacles or targeting specific cells).
These enhancements—board obstacles, target cell connections, and optional self-swapping—build on your game’s core while making it more challenging and fun. They encourage replay through variety and progression, ensuring players stay engaged. You can mix and match them based on feedback from the jam, keeping the game fresh and strategic!
