## Vibe Coded Game
- Sonnet 3.7 built the framework using the game_rules.md
- framework was generally working out of the gate
- copilot and sonnet 3.5 was used to refine the gui, update the AI and implement responsive design
- a lot of back and forth in this latter step
- nearly 100% coded by prompts
