# Connection Game: Rule Enhancement Proposals

This document outlines potential enhancements to the current two-player connection game, designed to increase strategic depth, replayability, and player engagement.

## 1. Progressive Challenge System

### Campaign Mode
- **Structure**: Series of 10-15 scenarios with increasing difficulty
- **Progression**: Each level introduces new constraints or advantages for the AI
- **Example Scenarios**:
  - "Breakthrough": Player starts with fewer pieces but moves twice per turn
  - "Outnumbered": AI has extra pieces but player gets special abilities
  - "Race Against Time": Win within a limited number of moves

### Puzzle Challenges
- **Design**: Pre-set board configurations requiring specific solution paths
- **Types**:
  - "Win in X Moves" puzzles
  - "Create Two Paths Simultaneously" scenarios
  - "Escape the Trap" situations

### Achievement System
- **Gameplay Rewards**: Unlock new starting configurations or visual themes
- **Challenge Badges**:
  - "Efficiency": Win in fewer than 12 moves
  - "Untouchable": Win without any of your pieces being swapped
  - "Strategist": Win without moving to empty cells (keeping all swaps active)

## 2. Strategic Board Variations

### Target Cell Connections
- **Implementation**: Instead of connecting entire rows, randomly select 2-3 cells in row 1 and row 6 that must be connected
- **Visual Design**: Highlight target cells with distinct markers
- **Strategic Impact**: Forces more diverse path planning and creates unique scenarios each game

### Board Terrain Features
- **Blocked Cells**: 2-4 randomly placed "obstacle" cells that neither player can occupy
- **Portal Cells**: Paired locations that allow instant movement between them when landed on
- **Power Cells**: Special locations that grant temporary abilities when occupied (double move, immunity to swapping)

### Asymmetric Starting Positions
- **Balanced Asymmetry**: Different but equivalent starting arrangements
- **Examples**:
  - Player A: 6 pieces in concentrated formation vs Player B: 8 pieces in spread formation
  - Player A: 8 normal pieces vs Player B: 6 pieces with 2 special "power pieces"

## 3. Enhanced Piece Mechanics

### Self-Swapping
- **Mechanic**: Allow players to swap positions between their own adjacent pieces
- **Cost**: Both pieces become marked as swapped
- **Strategic Value**: Enables quick repositioning at the cost of vulnerability

### Piece Promotion
- **Trigger**: When a piece reaches the opponent's back row (row 0 for Player A, row 7 for Player B)
- **Enhanced Abilities**:
  - Can move up to 2 spaces in one direction
  - Can jump over a single piece (own or opponent's)
  - Immune to swapping for one turn after promotion

### Strategic Unmarking
- **Mechanic**: If a swapped piece swaps with an opponent's swapped piece, both become unmarked
- **Implementation**: This creates an interesting counter-strategy to mass swapping
- **Balance**: Prevents situations where too many pieces are locked as swapped

## 4. Special Abilities System

### Limited Power Moves
- **Resource Management**: Each player begins with 3 power tokens
- **Usage Options**:
  - **Teleport**: Move one piece to any empty cell (consumes 1 token)
  - **Unmark**: Remove the swapped status from one of your pieces (consumes 1 token)
  - **Double Turn**: Move two different pieces in sequence (consumes 2 tokens)
  - **Barrier**: Create a 1-turn obstacle in an empty cell (consumes 1 token)

### Piece Specialization
- **Implementation**: At game start, players can designate 2 of their pieces as "specialists"
- **Specialist Types**:
  - **Scout**: Can move 2 spaces in a straight line
  - **Blocker**: Cannot swap but blocks opponent's path creation when adjacent
  - **Disruptor**: Can unmark an opponent's swapped piece when adjacent to it

## 5. Dynamic Game Elements

### Phase Changes
- **Turn Counter**: Every 5 turns triggers a "phase change"
- **Effects**:
  - All swapped pieces become unmarked
  - Board orientation rotates 90° (pieces maintain relative positions)
  - New terrain features appear/disappear

### Neutral Pieces
- **Implementation**: 2-4 neutral pieces placed in the middle rows
- **Behavior**: 
  - Block movement but can be pushed to adjacent empty cells
  - Create temporary barriers in strategic locations
  - Cannot be swapped with, only pushed

### Environmental Effects
- **Turn-based Events**: Every 3-4 turns, a random effect activates:
  - **Shift**: All pieces in a randomly selected row or column shift one position
  - **Freeze**: All swapped pieces remain swapped for 2 turns regardless of moves
  - **Acceleration**: Next player gets two consecutive moves

## 6. Victory Condition Variations

### Multiple Path Victory
- **Primary Mode**: Require creating two separate connected paths between target rows
- **Partial Victory**: Single path creates a "contested win" with fewer points

### Control Points
- **Implementation**: Place 3-5 marked cells across the board
- **Victory Condition**: Win by controlling a majority of these points with your pieces
- **Hybrid Mode**: Win by either connection or control points majority

### King of the Hill
- **Central Zone**: Define a 2×2 area in the board center
- **Scoring**: Points accumulate for each turn a player has more pieces in the zone
- **Victory**: Win by either connection or reaching a target score

## Implementation Considerations

### Balance Adjustments
- All new mechanics should be tested for potential deadlock situations
- Power moves should have appropriate costs to prevent dominant strategies
- Consider implementing a maximum turn counter (30-40 moves) to prevent stalemates

### Player Experience
- Add optional tutorials for new mechanics
- Consider allowing players to select which rule variations to enable
- Implement visual cues for special abilities and effects

### AI Complexity
- Ensure AI can reasonably navigate the additional strategic options
- Create difficulty levels that progressively utilize more advanced tactics
- Allow AI handicaps/advantages for balanced play
